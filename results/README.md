# results
This folder should store the figures and lists generated by the scripts. Be careful about overwriting others' work

Desired format:
`TODO`.pdf

Use variations on the following code to generate such files:

>`import matplotlib
matplotlib.use('pdf')
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # must come after .use()
fig = plt.figure()
plt.scatter(dictionary_of_points.keys(), dictionary_of_points.values())
fig.savefig(results_path + 'filename.pdf', bbox_inches='tight')`
